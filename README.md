## Run HEP workflows from the web.


Binderized by [Kyle Cranmer](https://github.com/cranmer) and [Lukas Heinrich](https://github.com/lukasheinrich)

An example notebook on how to generate simulated high energy physics collision events using the generator package MadGraph. Simulated datasets obtained from this notebook can then be used to train and evalueate the performance generative models for physics.

### Usage:

This repository has been equipped with a Dockerfile to encapsulate its software environment. It can be used with the (http://mybinder.org) service to launch an ephemeral jupyter notebook server to run the notebook.

Click on the below badge and open the notebook `adage.ipynb`.
